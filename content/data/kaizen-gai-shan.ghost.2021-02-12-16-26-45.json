Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and\ntemplates. \n\nYou may not want content tagged with News to exist on: example.com/tag/news.\nInstead, you want it to exist on example.com/news .\n\nIn this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of\ncontent on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme\nto render each content type differently.\n\nThere are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few\ncommon examples: \n\n * Setting a custom home page with its own template\n * Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently,\n   and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content\n * Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by\n   specific authors\n * Including dates in permalinks for your posts\n * Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like \n   example.com/europe/story-title/\n   \n\n> Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using YAML\n[http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html] files. Read our dynamic routing \ndocumentation [https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/] for further details.\nNext: Apps & Integrations\nWork with all your favourite apps and tools using our integrations\n[/apps-integrations/], or create your own custom integrations with webhooks.","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/organising-your-content.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2021-02-08T15:40:39.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2021-02-08T15:40:39.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2021-02-08T15:40:41.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called tags and the ability to create custom site structures using dynamic routes.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"60215b78d976555710da46b1","uuid":"843ce726-16f7-41de-8459-9973abb2b78f","title":"Managing admin settings","slug":"admin-settings","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/private.png\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"/organising-content/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Make your site private\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"If you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because it's not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a basic shared pass-phrase.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"You can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost's General Settings:\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it.
