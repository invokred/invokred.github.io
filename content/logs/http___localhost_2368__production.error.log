And alongside, I was already interning at *[Capital Float](https://capitalfloat.com/)* which was one heck of a workload in itself (around a 4 hours commitment daily) and side by side managing my academics with a 9 pointer. So, the entire process was an excruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we? \\\\n\\\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other engagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\\\n1. Tuesday *and* Wednesday: Generate new leads \\\\n2. Thursday *and* Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\\\n3. Friday *and* Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays  \\\\n\\\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and Wednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in the evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at *[Entrepreneurship Cell](https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/)*, I had an arsenal of experiences to support me in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - *Lusha* and always *schedule my mails for 8AM the next day*. Lusha generally gives results with over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. ==One can also refer Adapt, RocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha.== And now moving on to the 3 general questions...\\\"}],[\\\"markdown\\\",{\\\"markdown\\\":\\\"### 1. Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2. In case of **Soonicorns/ Unicorns**: Mail the **VPs** of your profile, e.g. Data Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold enough, you can even target CxOs. \\\\n3. In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity. So, I possessed MBA level knowledge in this field. \\\\n**Quantitative Finance** - IM Dept. made me super-proficient in Probability in Statistics. And on top of that, I have a knack for money and investing. Plus working at Capital Float in the consumer lending segment built my foundation for exploring more opportunities in finance.\\\\n**Data Science & Analytics** - Oh come on!

I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity. So, I possessed MBA level knowledge in this field. \\\\n**Quantitative Finance** - IM Dept. made me super-proficient in Probability in Statistics.

To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe.

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2. In case of **Soonicorns/ Unicorns**: Mail the **VPs** of your profile, e.g. Data Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold enough, you can even target CxOs. \\\\n3. In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you).

In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe.

The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2. In case of **Soonicorns/ Unicorns**: Mail the **VPs** of your profile, e.g. Data Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold enough, you can even target CxOs. \\\\n3. In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I\\npondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\\nyear alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical. Hence, I\\nfixated to churn out an equally prestigious opportunity by my own grit.\\n\\nI started the battle from January 3rd as I had made it one of my new year\\nresolutions to not back down in the middle whatever may come. And alongside, I\\nwas already interning at Capital Float [https://capitalfloat.com/] which was one\\nheck of a workload in itself (around a 4 hours commitment daily) and side by\\nside managing my academics with a 9 pointer. So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\nFirms who were kind to atleast provide a chance\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. My problem is that I\\nlove everything I study.\\n\\nSupply Chain - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already\\nengulfed the entire bible of Supply Chain\\n[https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi] \\nout of curiosity. So, I possessed MBA level knowledge in this field.\\nQuantitative Finance - IM Dept. made me super-proficient in Probability in\\nStatistics. And on top of that, I have a knack for money and investing. Plus\\nworking at Capital Float in the consumer lending segment built my foundation for\\nexploring more opportunities in finance.\\nData Science & Analytics - Oh come on!

Lusha generally gives results with over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. ==One can also refer Adapt, RocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha.== And now moving on to the 3 general questions...\\\"}],[\\\"markdown\\\",{\\\"markdown\\\":\\\"# Firms who were kind to atleast provide a chance\\\\n\\\"}],[\\\"markdown\\\",{\\\"markdown\\\":\\\"### 1. Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2. In case of **Soonicorns/ Unicorns**: Mail the **VPs** of your profile, e.g. Data Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold enough, you can even target CxOs. \\\\n3. In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2. In case of **Soonicorns/ Unicorns**: Mail the **VPs** of your profile, e.g. Data Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold enough, you can even target CxOs. \\\\n3. In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

So, I\\'m a Dual Degree student in my third year\\nright now, which means I got my CDC coming up this August. Although, it never\\nmade sense to me to wait another year to get the same opportunities as the ones\\ngiven to the B. Tech folks. There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I\\npondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\\nyear alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical. Hence, I\\nfixated to churn out an equally prestigious opportunity by my own grit.\\n\\nI started the battle from January 3rd as I had made it one of my new year\\nresolutions to not back down in the middle whatever may come. And alongside, I\\nwas already interning at Capital Float [https://capitalfloat.com/] which was one\\nheck of a workload in itself (around a 4 hours commitment daily) and side by\\nside managing my academics with a 9 pointer. So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\nFirms who were kind to atleast provide a chance\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. My problem is that I\\nlove everything I study.\\n\\nSupply Chain - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already\\nengulfed the entire bible of Supply Chain\\n[https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi] \\nout of curiosity. So, I possessed MBA level knowledge in this field.\\nQuantitative Finance - IM Dept. made me super-proficient in Probability in\\nStatistics. And on top of that, I have a knack for money and investing. Plus\\nworking at Capital Float in the consumer lending segment built my foundation for\\nexploring more opportunities in finance.\\nData Science & Analytics - Oh come on!

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2. In case of **Soonicorns/ Unicorns**: Mail the **VPs** of your profile, e.g. Data Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold enough, you can even target CxOs. \\\\n3. In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

What\\'s the use, it\\'s just your off-campus internship try.\\nIsn\\'t your CDC next year? Then why are you mailing these kinda guns?\\nCOVID\\'s there dude, don\\'t mind much, let it go...\\n\\n\\nThrough all kinda advices and waves of words I received, let me first explain\\nwhy I pursued it in first place. So, I\\'m a Dual Degree student in my third year\\nright now, which means I got my CDC coming up this August. Although, it never\\nmade sense to me to wait another year to get the same opportunities as the ones\\ngiven to the B. Tech folks. There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I\\npondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\\nyear alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical. Hence, I\\nfixated to churn out an equally prestigious opportunity by my own grit.\\n\\nI started the battle from January 3rd as I had made it one of my new year\\nresolutions to not back down in the middle whatever may come. And alongside, I\\nwas already interning at Capital Float [https://capitalfloat.com/] which was one\\nheck of a workload in itself (around a 4 hours commitment daily) and side by\\nside managing my academics with a 9 pointer. So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. My problem is that I\\nlove everything I study.\\n\\nSupply Chain - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already\\nengulfed the entire bible of Supply Chain\\n[https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi] \\nout of curiosity. So, I possessed MBA level knowledge in this field.\\nQuantitative Finance - IM Dept. made me super-proficient in Probability in\\nStatistics. And on top of that, I have a knack for money and investing. Plus\\nworking at Capital Float in the consumer lending segment built my foundation for\\nexploring more opportunities in finance.\\nData Science & Analytics - Oh come on!

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2. In case of **Soonicorns/ Unicorns**: Mail the **VPs** of your profile, e.g. Data Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold enough, you can even target CxOs. \\\\n3. In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\\\n\\\\n==Personal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out just because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely on this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/ Debsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.==\\\\n    \\\\n### 2. How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

Then why are you mailing these kinda guns?\\nCOVID\\'s there dude, don\\'t mind much, let it go...\\n\\n\\nThrough all kinda advices and waves of words I received, let me first explain\\nwhy I pursued it in first place. So, I\\'m a Dual Degree student in my third year\\nright now, which means I got my CDC coming up this August. Although, it never\\nmade sense to me to wait another year to get the same opportunities as the ones\\ngiven to the B. Tech folks. There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I\\npondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\\nyear alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical. Hence, I\\nfixated to churn out an equally prestigious opportunity by my own grit.\\n\\nI started the battle from January 3rd as I had made it one of my new year\\nresolutions to not back down in the middle whatever may come. And alongside, I\\nwas already interning at Capital Float [https://capitalfloat.com/] which was one\\nheck of a workload in itself (around a 4 hours commitment daily) and side by\\nside managing my academics with a 9 pointer. So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. My problem is that I\\nlove everything I study.\\n\\nSupply Chain - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already\\nengulfed the entire bible of Supply Chain\\n[https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi] \\nout of curiosity. So, I possessed MBA level knowledge in this field.\\nQuantitative Finance - IM Dept. made me super-proficient in Probability in\\nStatistics. And on top of that, I have a knack for money and investing.

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you).

In case of **Small Fish** (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail **CEO/ CTO** and no one below in the hierarchy.

Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right?

What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.

Then why are you mailing these kinda guns?\\nCOVID\\'s there dude, don\\'t mind much, let it go...\\n\\n\\nThrough all kinda advices and waves of words I received, let me first explain\\nwhy I pursued it in first place. So, I\\'m a Dual Degree student in my third year\\nright now, which means I got my CDC coming up this August. Although, it never\\nmade sense to me to wait another year to get the same opportunities as the ones\\ngiven to the B. Tech folks. There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I\\npondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\\nyear alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical. Hence, I\\nfixated to churn out an equally prestigious opportunity by my own grit.\\n\\nI started the battle from January 3rd as I had made it one of my new year\\nresolutions to not back down in the middle whatever may come. And alongside, I\\nwas already interning at Capital Float [https://capitalfloat.com/] which was one\\nheck of a workload in itself (around a 4 hours commitment daily) and side by\\nside managing my academics with a 9 pointer. So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. My problem is that I\\nlove everything I study.\\n\\nSupply Chain - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already\\nengulfed the entire bible of Supply Chain\\n[https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi] \\nout of curiosity.

There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I pondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical.

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.==\\\\n2.

How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing unique people just isn\\'t enough, **==YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO.==** Through all of my emails, I had a mean of **8 followups**. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you).

In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé.

So, I\\'m a Dual Degree student in my third year\\nright now, which means I got my CDC coming up this August. Although, it never\\nmade sense to me to wait another year to get the same opportunities as the ones\\ngiven to the B. Tech folks. There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I\\npondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\\nyear alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical.

So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet.

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you).

How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration).

And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter.

So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise).

And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet.

Who to mail?\\\\n1. For **top guns**/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go  for **Campus Recruiting HRs**. ==Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you).

How much to mail?\\\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around **2 to 2.5 hours** daily **6 days a week** for **6 continous weeks** to score my fate. **==In total, I MAILED 230 PEOPLE== with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to.** Out of those, only 163 emails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the frustration).

And to my most dear leads, I maxed the followups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who didn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out anyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop right? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh `STACK OVERFLOW ERROR`) That counter was 10 in my case. \\\\nAnd yes, ==Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I advise to keep any expectations.== Some people get their offer**s** in 50 emails, some in 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it vehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to move on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll explain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly). \\\\n\\\\n### 3. What to mail?\\\\n**Make a delicious cover letter.** Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm. Imagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to score a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why can\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? ==Getting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won.== And the probability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an **outstanding résumé**. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by reading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation. And yes, ==EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE==. **I had applied for 3 profiles in my case -  Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply Chain; spending  around 40 hours preparing my résumés.** Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s because I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. *My problem is that I love everything I study.*\\\\n\\\\n**Supply Chain** - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already engulfed the entire [bible of Supply Chain](https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) out of curiosity.

You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter.

What\\'s the use, it\\'s just your off-campus internship try.\\nIsn\\'t your CDC next year? Then why are you mailing these kinda guns?\\nCOVID\\'s there dude, don\\'t mind much, let it go...\\n\\n\\nThrough all kinda advices and waves of words I received, let me first explain\\nwhy I pursued it in first place. So, I\\'m a Dual Degree student in my third year\\nright now, which means I got my CDC coming up this August. Although, it never\\nmade sense to me to wait another year to get the same opportunities as the ones\\ngiven to the B. Tech folks. There wasn\\'t a skill imbalance as such when I\\npondered in comparison, then why the bias? I had slogged my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\\nyear alike so turning back now and peacing out didn\\'t seem logical. Hence, I\\nfixated to churn out an equally prestigious opportunity by my own grit.\\n\\nI started the battle from January 3rd as I had made it one of my new year\\nresolutions to not back down in the middle whatever may come. And alongside, I\\nwas already interning at Capital Float [https://capitalfloat.com/] which was one\\nheck of a workload in itself (around a 4 hours commitment daily) and side by\\nside managing my academics with a 9 pointer. So, the entire process was an\\nexcruiciating eye killer for sure. So, let\\'s start from sratch, shall we?\\n\\nFirst of all, I prepared a suitable timeline keeping in mind my labs and other\\nengagements. All in all, my schedule looked something like this:\\n\\n 1. Tuesday and Wednesday: Generate new leads\\n 2. Thursday and Sunday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Tuesdays\\n 3. Friday and Monday: FOLLOW UP on the leads generated on Wednesdays\\n\\nLuckily my time-table supported me here, as I didn\\'t have labs on Tuesdays and\\nWednesdays; so I was able to wrap Capital Float\\'s work in afternoons and mail in\\nthe evenings. And working for Corporate and Media Relations at Entrepreneurship\\nCell [https://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/], I had an arsenal of experiences to support\\nme in mailing. I used to gather email-ids from our internal CRM - Lusha and\\nalways schedule my mails for 8AM the next day. Lusha generally gives results\\nwith over 80% accuracy so that wasn\\'t a buzzkill. One can also refer Adapt,\\nRocketReach, Hunter if they don\\'t possess the charms of Lusha. And now moving on\\nto the 3 general questions...\\n\\n1. Who to mail?\\n 1. For top guns/ big sharks (whatever you love to call them): Go for Campus\\n    Recruiting HRs. Personal note: DON\\'T email partners or any regular employees\\n    (and never to SDEs/ Analysts, they got no power to help you). I repeat, just\\n    DON\\'T waste your valuable time on any other department other than the HR.\\n 2. In case of Soonicorns/ Unicorns: Mail the VPs of your profile, e.g. Data\\n    Science Head/ Product Management Head etc. Sometimes if you feel bold\\n    enough, you can even target CxOs.\\n 3. In case of Small Fish (a startup with series B or smaller funding): Mail \\n    CEO/ CTO and no one below in the hierarchy. I never tried this section for\\n    summer internships actually, because as I mentioned earlier, I wanted a CDC\\n    level firm in my bag and plus I was already working in a soonicorn.\\n\\nPersonal note: I don\\'t believe the fact that an IIT KGP alumni will help you out\\njust because he\\'s your alumni. You gotta build a profile anyway, so don\\'t rely\\non this crap. Even if you belong to a club which CDC respects (E or A Cells/\\nDebsoc/ KOSS) the chances of an alumnus jacking you an intern in miniscule.\\n\\n2. How much to mail?\\nThis is the toughest part. To be honest, it took me around 2 to 2.5 hours daily \\n6 days a week for 6 continous weeks to score my fate. In total, I MAILED 230\\nPEOPLE with around 2-3 people per firm I applied to. Out of those, only 163\\nemails made their way, i.e. 67 emails bounced back (one can only imagine the\\nfrustration). The soup doesn\\'t end here, there\\'s more to the recipe. Mailing\\nunique people just isn\\'t enough, YOU GOTTA FOLLOW UP TOO. Through all of my\\nemails, I had a mean of 8 followups. And to my most dear leads, I maxed the\\nfollowups upto 10. Going above that didn\\'t make any sense, as the person who\\ndidn\\'t respond to you in 10 followups obviously doesn\\'t wish to help you out\\nanyway. Plus logically there has to be an end counter for the followup loop\\nright? (Nobody likes infinite loops, duh STACK OVERFLOW ERROR) That counter was\\n10 in my case.\\nAnd yes, Please don\\'t pressume any conversion ratios beforehand, nor would I\\nadvise to keep any expectations. Some people get their offers in 50 emails, some\\nin 100, and a few nutjobs like me who won\\'t take no for an answer go for it\\nvehemently. if circumstances don\\'t chisel you out a way, you must be ready to\\nmove on at the end of the day. Just don\\'t get too emotionally attached (I\\'ll\\nexplain my trauma shortly; even my victory doesn\\'t come that smoothly).\\n\\n3. What to mail?\\nMake a delicious cover letter. Enough to give the HR/ receiver an orgasm.\\nImagine! The SDE folks fap on their code for more than 200 hours in total to\\nscore a good CDC (though their CVs suck - content formulation wise). So why\\ncan\\'t non-SDE folks spend atleast 10 hours coming up with a sexy cover letter? \\nGetting the HR to just read your email is half the battle won. And the\\nprobability increases with every followup you put. Next, make an outstanding\\nrésumé. If your friends don\\'t say that their ass cracked into 4 pieces by\\nreading your résumé, then you gotta work harder on your content/ formulation.\\nAnd yes, EVERY PROFILE GETS DIFFERENT CONTENT OFCOURSE. I had applied for 3\\nprofiles in my case - Quantitative Finance, Data Science & Analytics, and Supply\\nChain; spending around 40 hours preparing my résumés. Why 3 you may ask; it\\'s\\nbecause I still haven\\'t figured out my career path yet. My problem is that I\\nlove everything I study.\\n\\nSupply Chain - it\\'s in my course curriculum at IM Dept., and I had already\\nengulfed the entire bible of Supply Chain\\n[https://www.amazon.in/Supply-Chain-Management-Pearson-Chopra/dp/9353065968/ref=asc_df_9353065968/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397082863904&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13706448126666251201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062220&hvtargid=pla-611081049499&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi] \\nout of curiosity.
